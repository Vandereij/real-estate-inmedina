							From welcoming guests to guiding homeowners

							Before launching InMedina, we spent decades working
							in Moroccan hospitality, running guest houses,
							restoring riads, and learning how travelers actually
							experience these spaces. Those years taught us what
							truly matters: good bones, thoughtful circulation,
							reliable comfort, and a feeling of ease the moment
							you step inside. Now we bring that perspective to
							buyers and investors who want properties that are
							beautiful, functional, and resilient over time.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
							We understand not just how a house looks in photos,
							but how it feels to live in, to host in, and to
							maintain year after year. That is the lens we use
							when we walk into a potential property on your
							behalf.

							Two different journeys leading to the same medina
						</h2>
						<p className="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
							InMedina grew out of two parallel paths: one shaped
							by returning to Morocco again and again, drawn by
							its balance of intensity and calm; the other by
							leaving a traditional craft behind to follow the
							call of the desert. Together, these experiences
							shape how we approach each property, with curiosity,
							respect, and a clear sense of what truly works for
							the people who will use it.

									Stefano first arrived in Morocco as a
									traveler, moving fast from cities to desert,
									trying to see &quot;everything&quot; in a
									single trip. He kept coming back, slowing
									down, exploring new regions, and paying
									attention to how different spaces made
									people feel. Over time, that curiosity
									turned into a vocation: creating and
									curating places where guests feel grounded,
									whether they stay a weekend or a season.
								</p>
								<p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
									That instinct for what feels right now
									shapes how he presents InMedina to the
									world. He builds the brand&apos;s presence,
									tells the story of each property without
									overselling it, and makes sure the
									experience people imagine online matches
									what they&apos;ll actually find when they
									arrive. His work is about clarity and
									trust, helping people understand what
									they&apos;re choosing, and why it might be
									exactly what they need.

									Alberto left Sardinia and the forge as a

									discovered desert towns, Berber hospitality,
									and music that spoke of long journeys and
									resilience. Those early years taught him to
									trust instincts, welcome chance encounters,
									and look beneath the surface of things.
								</p>
								<p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
									That practical sensibility now guides how he
									supports projects and day-to-day logistics.
									He coordinates with local suppliers and
									craftspeople, helps oversee renovation
									progress, and focuses on making sure each
									project moves forward in a grounded,
									realistic way, so that the properties our
									clients choose are not just beautiful in
									theory, but solid and welcoming in practice.
